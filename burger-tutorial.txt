* STEP 1 - Find the Signal
Open Universal Radio Hacker (urh) and bring up the Spectrum
Analyzer (under the File menu). Determine the frequency of
the pager transmitter.

* STEP 2 - Capture the Signal 
Select Record Signals (under the File menu) and capture 
several transmissions. 

* STEP 3 - Tune and Demodulate 
Open the Interpretation tab and modify the parameters
(especially Samples/Symbol) to demodulate and extract
the raw bits from each transmission.

* STEP 4 - Decode the Raw Payload
Switch to the Analysis tab. Determine the encoding 
scheme and extract the decoded bits from your raw data.

* STEP 5 - Identify the Data
Determine the function of the bytes in your decoded 
data. You do not need to understand every byte, but
just enough to compromise the system.

* STEP 6 - Computing the Checksum
Determine the algorithm for calculating the checksum
for a given payload. There may be shortcuts...

* STEP 7 - Transmit Takeover Signal
Using URH's Generate tab, modify a decoded payload
to activate your pager.
